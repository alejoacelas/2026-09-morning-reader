10-minute sittings instead of reading cover to cover.

Below is the {part}text, one paragraph per line. Each line starts with
[paragraph index @ word offset]. Headings start with "##".

Divide the text into consecutive reading blocks. Each block starts at a paragraph
index and runs until the next block starts. Rules:
- Aim for {target} words per block. A block must never exceed {max} words or fall under
  {min}: compute each block's length by subtracting word offsets, and if a chapter is
  longer than {max} words, break it into two or more blocks at a scene change. Break at natural pauses: chapter or section starts, scene
  changes, the end of an argument.
- Cover every paragraph. Mark front matter, contents lists, indexes, notes, appendices
  of tables and licence text with "skip": true.
- "hook": one line, at most 20 words, saying concretely what happens or is argued in
  the block. Use plain words and the book's own terms; don't dress it in modern jargon
  or hype.
- "entry_point": true for the 15-25% of blocks most rewarding to read cold: famous
  passages, vivid episodes, self-contained arguments or stories.
- "recap": for entry points only, 1-3 sentences giving what a reader starting here needs
  (who is who, what just happened, where we are). null for the book's opening block and
  for non-entry blocks.
- "playlist_prompt": a Spotify AI Playlist prompt (under 25 words) matched to the block's
  mood, subject and the place and era it evokes.
- "title": a short block title, e.g. "Chapter IV: the gauchos' bolas".
