# Morning reader

A personal Android app for a 45-minute morning reading session. It serves books
as self-contained 5–15 minute blocks, mixed with long blog posts and short
videos. You approve one block at a time, and a block can start only if it fits in
the time left today. After a block you can mark the book keep going, maybe later or
done with this, and Today orders books by that choice.

## Build and install

Requires JDK 17 and the Android SDK (see `AGENTS.md` for paths) and the phone
reachable through `~/best/dotfiles/bin/adb-phone`.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
./gradlew assembleDebug
~/best/dotfiles/bin/adb-phone install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Boox e-reader

The same APK runs on the Onyx Boox Go7, where it is the home screen. On an Onyx
device the app turns black on white and leaves out videos, Spotify prompts,
secondary material and feature requests. The grid icon on Today opens Boox's own
launcher, for its library, other apps and settings.

Every `adb-phone` and `./pack` command reaches the Boox when `PHONE_SERIAL=ec27fd9`
is set, for example `PHONE_SERIAL=ec27fd9 ./pack push`. Wireless debugging must be
on, and the Boox turns Wi-Fi off while asleep, so wake it first. Reading progress,
the budget and feeds are kept separately on each device.

After installing on the Boox, Boox may mark the app disabled; enable it and make it
the home screen with:

```bash
b() { PHONE_SERIAL=ec27fd9 ~/best/dotfiles/bin/adb-phone "$@"; }
b shell pm enable com.alejoacelas.morningreader
b shell am start -n com.alejoacelas.morningreader/.MainActivity   # registers the home screen
b shell cmd package set-home-activity com.alejoacelas.morningreader/.Home
```

To go back to Boox's launcher, run
`b shell cmd package set-home-activity com.onyx/.StartupActivity`.

## Add books

Books come from Project Gutenberg, using the Standard Ebooks edition when there is
one. `./pack` builds a book pack on the Mac and pushes it to the phone. The app
loads new packs when it opens or when you tap refresh.

```bash
./pack search "tale of two cities"   # list Gutenberg matches with their ids
./pack add 98                        # build and push by Gutenberg id
./pack add "tale of two cities"      # or build the top search match
./pack starter                       # build and push the first shelf
./pack sources                       # find secondary material for packs that have none
./pack sources 84                    # or redo it for one book
./pack annotate                      # add character notes to packs built before they existed
./pack push                          # re-push every built pack
```

## Wish list

A Chrome bookmarks folder doubles as a wish list. The packer reads Chrome's bookmark
files each time you ask, so a book bookmarked this morning shows up the next run.

```bash
./pack wishlist                      # list wished-for books and whether each is on Gutenberg
./pack wishlist build                # build and push up to 3 that aren't built yet (--limit N)
./pack wishlist folders              # show bookmark folders that look meant for books
./pack wishlist folder "To read"     # choose the folder (saved in cache/settings.json)
```

`starter` builds the fixed first shelf and `add` builds any one book; use `wishlist
build` to pick the next books from what you've bookmarked. Only public-domain books
are on Gutenberg, so most modern titles are listed as "not on Gutenberg". The first
check of new bookmarks costs about $0.03 in Gemini calls; results are cached in
`cache/wishlist.json`.

A pack costs about $0.02–0.65 in Gemini calls, roughly $0.13 per 100,000 words,
and takes about a minute.

## Secondary material

At the end of a block the app offers one or two things to watch, listen to or read
about the book or its author. They come only from the trusted sources in
`packer/trusted-sources.toml`: YouTube channels such as the National Theatre and
Gresham College, BBC *In Our Time* and *Great Lives*, The Public Domain Review, and
biographies on Project Gutenberg. Edit that file to add or drop a source. Gemini keeps
the candidates that really concern the book or author, which costs under a cent a book.
Each YouTube channel searched costs 100 of the 10,000 free daily quota units, so with
six channels about 16 books a day can be searched; when the quota runs out the other
sources still work and `./pack sources <id>` adds videos the next day.

## Notes

Select text while reading to Explain it, Ask a question about it, or add a Note.
The Notes tab lists your notes and your questions with their answers, each with the
book, block and text you selected. Explain answers aren't listed. `./pack pull`
copies the notes, the questions and answers, and the log of times nothing fit the
minutes left into `cache/phone/`.

## Blog feeds

The phone checks feeds every 12 hours and keeps posts of 5 minutes or more. To
load an OPML export (for example from Feedly), push it with
`./pack opml path/to/feeds.opml`, or use Settings → Import OPML on the phone.
Settings also adds and removes single feeds.

## Feature requests

Type a request at the bottom of Settings, or tap the request icon next to the music
note while reading, and tap Send. It becomes an issue on this
repository. Requests made offline wait on the phone and go out once it's online.

## Secrets

The app and `./pack` read API keys from an ignored `.env`. `AGENTS.md` says where
each key lives in 1Password and how to rebuild the file.
